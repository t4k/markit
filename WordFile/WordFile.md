  - content: Interview in three sessions, October-November 2009, with
      David Baltimore, Robert Andrews Millikan Professor of Biology and
      president emeritus of Caltech (1997-2006). He recalls his
      childhood and early education in Great Neck, NY, his aptitude for
      science, and a summer at the Jackson Laboratory in Maine (1955),
      which confirmed his vocation. He discusses interest in molecular
      biology at Swarthmore (B.A. 1960); 1959 summer at Cold Spring
      Harbor with G. Streisinger; meeting S. Luria and C. Levinthal;
      graduate work at MIT and Rockefeller (PhD 1964); 1961 summer at
      Albert Einstein College of Medicine; postdoc at MIT with J.
      Darnell and Einstein with J. Hurwitz. Recalls his discovery of
      polio polymerase and demonstration that RNA chains initiate with a
      triphosphate. In 1965 he is invited to join Salk Institute by R.
      Dulbecco; returns to MIT as associate professor in 1968. Recalls
      his 1970 discovery of reverse transcriptase and copublication with
      H. Temin; 1975 Asilomar conference on recombinant DNA; 1975 Nobel
      Prize with Temin and Dulbecco; founding of Whitehead Institute for
      Biomedical Research; National Academy of Sciences committee on
      national strategy for AIDS. Comments briefly on investigation of
      T. Imanishi-Kari for fraud and his return to MIT from Rockefeller
      University in 1994. He discusses vetting process for Caltech
      presidency, his 1998 inauguration, and highlights of his
      presidency, including purchase of St.Â Luke's Medical Center, \$1.4
      billion capital campaign, and building Broad Center for the
      Biological Sciences. Comments on Caltech architecture, including
      Cahill Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics; receiving National
      Medal of Science in 2000; L. Van Parijs dismissal from MIT and
      prior work in Baltimore's lab; and the prospects for human
      enhancement and understanding of consciousness.
